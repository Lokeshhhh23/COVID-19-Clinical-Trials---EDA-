# COVID-19-Clinical-Trials -EDA 
ClinicalTrials.gov is a database of privately and publicly funded clinical studies  conducted around the world. It is maintained by the National Institute of Health. All data  is publicly available and the site provides a direct download feature which makes it  super easy to use relevant data for analysis. 

This dataset consists of clinical trials related to COVID 19 studies presented on the site.
The dataset consists of XML files where each XML file corresponds to one study. The
 filename is the NCT number which is a unique identifier of a study in the ClinicalTrials
 repository. Additionally, a CSV file has also been provided, which might not have as
 much information as contained in the XML file, but does give sufficient information.
